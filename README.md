# ATM Simulator

Welcome to the ATM Simulator project! This Java-based application provides a comprehensive banking experience, featuring a user-friendly interface, robust security measures, and optimized performance.

## Overview

In this project, I've engineered an ATM simulator using Java, integrating Swing for the frontend and JDBC for seamless connectivity to a MySQL database. The project stands as a testament to meticulous application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, advanced data structures inspired by CS608 Algorithms, and stringent data security measures.

## Key Components

### 1. User-Friendly Interface

The ATM interface, developed with Java Swing, ensures an intuitive and responsive design. Users can effortlessly navigate through essential functions such as withdrawal, deposit, and balance inquiry, guaranteeing a seamless banking experience.

### 2. OOP Principles at Play

The project's foundation rests on the solid application of OOP principles, embracing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This approach creates a modular and extensible codebase, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### 3. Data Structure Optimization

Taking inspiration from CS608 Algorithms, the project incorporates advanced data structures to optimize critical aspects of the code. These optimizations significantly enhance the performance of transactions, ensuring swift and efficient processing.

### 4. Security Measures

A paramount concern in this project was the security of user data. Encryption techniques were implemented to safeguard sensitive information during communication between the ATM application and the MySQL database. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of user data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or tampering.

## Usage

To use the ATM Simulator:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Ensure MySQL is installed and configure the database connection parameters.
4. Run the application and enjoy a seamless banking experience!
